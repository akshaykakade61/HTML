            Nagpur is named after the river Nag which flows through the city. The old Nagpur (today called 'Mahal') is  
            situated on north banks of the river Nag. The suffix pur means "city" in many Indian languages. 
                                                                                                                            
            One of the earlier names of Nagpur was "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the Marathi and  
            Sanskrit word fana (फणा; meaning hood of a cobra). Nagpur's first newspaper was named Fanindramani, 
            which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that lights up  
            the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper.B. R. Ambedkar claimed that both the city and the river are  
            named after "Nag people".During British rule, the name of the city was spelt and pronounced as "Nagpore"

            In the 18th century, the city was created by the leader of Gond Dynasty named Bakht Buland Shah in the first half 
            of the century. Human existence around present-day Nagpur can be traced back 3000 years to the 8th century BCE. 
            Mehir burial sites at the Drugdhamna (near the Mhada colony) indicate that the megalithic culture existed around Nagpur 
            and is still followed.The first reference to the name "Nagpur" is found in a 10th-century copper-plate inscription discovered 
            at Devali in the neighbouring Wardha district. The inscription is a record of grant of a village situated in the Visaya (district)
            of Nagpura-Nandivardhana during the time of the Rastrakuta king Krsna III in the Saka year 862 (940 CE).Towards the end of the 3rd 
            century, King Vindhyasakti is known to have ruled the Nagpur region. In the 4th century, the Vakataka Dynasty ruled over the Nagpur 
            region and surrounding areas and had good relations with the Gupta Empire. The Vakataka king Prithvisena I moved his capital to 
            Nagardhan (ancient name Nandivardhana), 38 kilometres (24 mi) from Nagpur.[39] After the Vakatakas, the region came under the rule of 
            the Hindu kingdoms of the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas. The Paramaras of Malwa appear to have controlled the Nagpur region in the 
            11th century. A prashasti inscription of the Paramara king Lakshmadeva (r. c. 1086–1094) has been found at Nagpur.[40] Subsequently, the 
            region came under the Yadavas of Devagiri. In 1296, Allauddin Khilji invaded the Yadava Kingdom after capturing Deogiri, after which the 
            Tughlaq Dynasty came to power in 1317. In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire conquered the region, however during Mughal era, regional 
            administration was carried out by the Gond kingdom of Deogarh-Nagpur in the Chhindwara district of the modern-day state of Madhya Pradesh.
            In the 18th, century Bhonsles of the Maratha Empire established the Nagpur Kingdom based in the city.

            After Bhakt Buland Shah, the next Raja (king) of Deogarh was Chand Sultan, who resided principally in the country below the hills, fixing his capital at Nagpur, 
            which he turned into a walled town.On Chand Sultan's death in 1739, Wali Shah, an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, usurped the throne and Chand Sultan's widow
            invoked the aid of the Maratha leader Raghoji Bhosale of Berar in the interest of her sons Akbar Shah and Burhan Shah. The usurper was put to death and
            the rightful heirs placed on the throne. After 1743, a series of Maratha rulers came to power, starting with Raghoji Bhosale, who conquered the territories of 
            Deogarh, Chanda and Chhattisgarh by 1751.

            Nagpur was burnt substantially in 1765 and again partially in 1811 by marauding Pindaris. However, the development of the city of Nagpur continued.[45] In 1803 Raghoji 
            II Bhosale joined the Peshwa against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, but the British prevailed. After Raghoji II's death in 1816, his son Parsaji was deposed 
            and murdered by Mudhoji II Bhosale. Despite the fact that he had entered into a treaty with the British in the same year, Mudhoji joined the Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha
            War in 1817 against the British but suffered a defeat at Sitabuldi in present-day Nagpur. The fierce battle was a turning point as it laid the foundations of the downfall of 
            the Bhosales and paved the way for the British acquisition of Nagpur city.[46] Mudhoji was deposed after a temporary restoration to the throne, after which the British placed 
            Raghoji III Bhosale, the grandchild of Raghoji II, on the throne. During the rule of Raghoji III(which lasted till 1840), the region was administered by a British resident. 
            In 1853, the British took control of Nagpur after Raghoji III died without leaving an heir.

           From 1853 to 1861, the Nagpur Province (which consisted of the present Nagpur region, Chhindwara, and Chhattisgarh) became part of the Central Provinces and Berar and came under 
           the administration of a commissioner under the British central government, with Nagpur as its capital. Berar was added in 1903.The advent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway(GIP) 
           in 1867 spurred its development as a trade centre.[49] Tata group started its first textile mill at Nagpur, formally known as Central India Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. The 
           company was popularly known as "Empress Mills" as it was inaugurated on 1 January 1877, the day queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India.

           The non-co-operation movement was launched in the Nagpur session of 1920.[51] The city witnessed a Hindu–Muslim riot in 1923 which had profound impact on K. B. Hedgewar,[52] who in 
           1925 founded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organisation in Mohitewada Mahal, Nagpur with an idea of creating a Hindu nation. After the 1927 Nagpur riots 
           RSS gained further popularity in Nagpur and the organisation grew nationwide.
